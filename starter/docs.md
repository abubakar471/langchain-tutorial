# reasoning behind this project or repository
    its was for learning purpose and if question arises why we are using open ai, then it is just because open ai already has a 
    LLM, that we can use with our langchain

# initial ground work 
    > create a replit project from the dashboard using any language (Python)
    > name it , and create the replit

    $ pip install openai
    $ pip install langchain
    $ pip install --upgrade langchain

    > then get your open ai api key from open ai website, and store it into a variable or secret file, or in secret from replit
